## [Unreleased]

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Changed behavior when subscribing mail_type with variants (and not specifying variant), having `is_multi_variant` set to true - all variants are automatically subscribed together with the mail type. remp/crm#2723
  - Previously, only if `default_variant_id` was set, such variant would be subscribed. 
- Added list of subscribed variants to `/api/v1/users/subscribe` API response (parameter `subscribed_variants`). remp/crm#2723
- Fixed broken master search, which was hitting deprecated search URL. remp/remp#1265
